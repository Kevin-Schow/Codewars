Consider an array/list of sheep where some sheep may be missing from their place. We need a function that counts the number of sheep present in the array (true means present).

def count_sheeps(sheep):
    total = 0
    for e in sheep:
        if e:
            total += 1
    return total

def count_sheeps(arrayOfSheeps):
  return arrayOfSheeps.count(True)
