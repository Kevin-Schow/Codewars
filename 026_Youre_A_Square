A square of squares
You like building blocks. You especially like building
blocks that are squares. And what you even like more, is
to arrange them into a square of square building blocks!
However, sometimes, you cant arrange them into a square.
Instead, you end up with an ordinary rectangle! Those
blasted things! If you just had a way to know, whether
youre currently working in vainâ€¦ Wait! Thats it! You
just have to check if your number of building blocks
is a perfect square.

import math
def is_square(n):
        return (math.sqrt(n)).is_integer() if n >= 0 else False

import math
def is_square(n):
    return n > -1 and math.sqrt(n) % 1 == 0;
