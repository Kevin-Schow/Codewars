It's pretty straightforward. Your goal is to create a function that removes the first 
and last characters of a string. You're given one parameter, the original string. 
You don't have to worry with strings with less than two characters.

def remove_char(s):
    return s[1:len(s)-1]

def remove_char(s):
    return s[1: -1]

==============================
Given an array of integers your solution should find the smallest integer.
For example:
Given [34, 15, 88, 2] your solution will return 2
Given [34, -345, -1, 100] your solution will return -345

def find_smallest_int(arr):
    smallest = arr[0]
    for number in arr:
        if (number < smallest):
            smallest = number
    return smallest

def findSmallestInt(arr):
    return min(arr)

==============================
Complete the method that takes a boolean value and return a "Yes" string for true, or a "No" string for false.

def bool_to_word(boolean):
    return 'Yes' if boolean else 'No'

==============================
Consider an array/list of sheep where some sheep may be missing from their place. We need a function that counts the number of sheep present in the array (true means present).

def count_sheeps(sheep):
    total = 0
    for e in sheep:
        if e:
            total += 1
    return total

def count_sheeps(arrayOfSheeps):
  return arrayOfSheeps.count(True)

==============================
Make a simple function called greet that returns the most-famous "hello world!".

def greet():
    return "hello world!"

==============================
We need a function that can transform a string into a number. What ways of achieving this do you know?

def string_to_number(s):
    return int(s)
