Complete the square sum function so that it squares each number passed into it and then sums the results together.
For example, for [1, 2, 2] it should return 9 because 1^2 + 2^2 + 2^2 = 9.

def square_sum(numbers):
    total = 0
    for i in numbers:
        total += i ** 2
    return total

def square_sum(numbers):
    return sum(x ** 2 for x in numbers)
