In this little assignment you are given a string of space
separated numbers, and have to return the highest and lowest number.

import re

def high_and_low(numbers):
    largest = -9999
    smallest = 9999
    num = [i for i in re.split("[^-0-9]", numbers) if i != '']
    for i in num:
        if int(i) > int(largest):
            largest = i
        if int(i) < int(smallest):
            smallest = i
    return str(largest) + ' ' + str(smallest)


def high_and_low(numbers): #z.
    nn = [int(s) for s in numbers.split(" ")]
    return "%i %i" % (max(nn),min(nn))
