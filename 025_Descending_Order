Your task is to make a function that can take any non-negative
integer as a argument and return it with its digits in
descending order. Essentially, rearrange the digits to
create the highest possible number.


def descending_order(num):
    new_num = []
    result = ''
    for i in str(num):
        new_num += i
    new_num.sort(reverse=True)
    for j in new_num:
        result += j
    return int(result)

def Descending_Order(num):
    return int("".join(sorted(str(num), reverse=True)))
